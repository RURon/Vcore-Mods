## 3.1 Bed arms Mod ##

I like the old side mount of the linear rails better than the new rear mount - thus I changed the new arms to allow keeping the rails where they are. Additionally I modded the rear bed arm to include MFBS' clip in strain relief. I include his strain relief clip as I cannot find it on Thingiverse anymore.
