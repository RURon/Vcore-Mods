## Lid ##

This mod adds a top lid to the 300 VCore3. It is a mod of cyborgcnc's design: [Link](https://github.com/cyborgcnc/CYBORGCNC__RRVC3MOD) - I had some problems with Phil Brickwood's mod of the original design and decided to adjust it to my needs: I increased the height by 30 mm, modified the corner brackets so that you have identical length cross bars all around (there are 4 bottom and 4 top bars to print), removed the LED strip recess, added a mounting hole for a web cam in the front left corner and added bottom joiner clips with a cable clip for the webcam cable and an outlet tunnel in the back left corner for the webcam cable (my webcam does not connect to a Pi on the electronics panel). If you dont want to add/use hinges nor the front handle, you can simply print 4 times the "Bottom Sidebar".

You will need to print the two top corner brackets twice, 4 side clips, 8 bottom and 8 top clips.

***Warning: Just noticed that the STLs in the sub folder are not up to date. The top corner brackets STLs are wrong! Either use the TopCorner STEP files and generate the STLs from them or wait for me to fix the STLs***

DXF files for the panels are provided. It is designed for 3mm panels together with 1mm of compression (5mm wide) tape or similiar.

You also need M3 heat inserts, sized "M3-.05 SHORT" - if you already have heat inserts, maybe check the hole sizes and adjust accordingly.
